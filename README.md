👋 Hello, I am Oladeji Ajayi

I am a Cybersecurity Expert specialising in Security Operations (SOC), Threat Detection, Cyber Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance.
My expertise blends advanced analytical capability, enterprise risk strategy, and hands-on defensive security skills to strengthen organisational cyber resilience across both technical and governance layers.

With a strong background in data analysis, strategic decision-making, stakeholder communication, and technical security tooling, I bring a hybrid SOC + GRC skillset ideal for modern cybersecurity operations.

My mission is to deliver measurable security outcomes by turning:
🔹 data into intelligence,
🔹 alerts into action, and
🔹 risks into well-managed decisions.
